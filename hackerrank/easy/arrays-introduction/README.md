# Arrays Introduction

## Problem

An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

For arrays of a known size, $10$ in this case, use the following declaration:
	
    int arr[10]; //Declares an array named arr of size 10, i.e, you can 
    store 10 integers.
    
**Note**  Unlike C, C++ allows dynamic allocation of arrays at runtime without special calls like malloc().  If $n = 10$, `int arr[n]` will create an array with space for $10$ integers.  

Accessing elements of an array:

	Indexing in arrays starts from 0.So the first element is stored at 
    arr[0],the second element at arr[1] and so on through arr[9].
    
You will be given an array of $N$ integers and you have to print the integers in the reverse order.

    

**Input Format**

The first line of the input contains $N$,where $N$ is the number of integers.The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers.

**Constraints**

$1<=N<=1000$

$1<=A[i]<=10000$, where $A[i]$ is the $i^{th}$ integer in the array.


**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

Print the $N$ integers of the array in the reverse order, space-separated on a single line.

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;


int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */  
     int n;
     cin>>n;
     int arr[n];
     for (int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>arr[i];     
     }
     for (int j=n-1;j>=0;j--){
        cout<<arr[j]<<" ";
     }
    return 0;
}

```
